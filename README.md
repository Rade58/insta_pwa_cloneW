# My project made for practicing pwa techologies

## Bundled with webpack

### Webpack configuration is made to have multiple entry points and multiple outputs

Two pages are need with one fallback page (for offline if one of pages isn't availeable)

### Service Worker file I'm going to test only in production so it is going to be placed by hand inside build folder (dist FOLDER)

He needs to be on same file/folder level as the the index.html
