# Simple app made for practicing pwa techologies and setting up the right Webpack configuration with many presets

## Bundled with webpack

### Webpack configuration is made to have multiple entry points and multiple outputs, but single enaty and output should be also available as an option

Two pages are needed, with one fallback page (for offline if one of the pages isn't availeable)

### FOR DEVELOPING WITH MULTIPLE ENTRIES AND OUTPUTS EXECUTE yarn dev:multi SCRIPT

presets/webpack.multi.js will be merged with main configuration

You can still use

- yarn dev

SCRIPT FOR SINGE ENTRY POINT AND SINGLE OUTPUT

## COMPRESSION AND SERVING COMPRESSED JAVASCRIPT INSIDE HTML

[html-webpack-change-assets-extension-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-change-assets-extension-plugin) USED FO INSERTING COMPRESSED FILES IN PAGES (only JavaScript)

single entry point and output:

- yarn prod:single_compress_serve

multi entries and outputs

- yarn prod:multi_compress_serve

## FOR SERVICE WORKER I'LL TRY USE "serviceworker-webpack-plugin", AS A PRESET CONFIGURATION

["serviceworker-webpack-plugin"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serviceworker-webpack-plugin)

[git repo](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/serviceworker-webpack-plugin)

DEVELOPMENT SCRIPT

- yarn dev:multi:serviceworker

## manifest.json

Also, manifest.json and icons folder I'm going to place inside dist too :exclamation::exclamation: (CONSIDERING PLUGIN)

## To test production code with gzip use http-server

- yarn add http-server@0.9.0 (DOWNGRADED IT BECACAUSE ectatic ISN'T WORKING ON NEWEST VERSIONS)

- cd dist

- http-server -a localhost -p 7000 -c-1 --gzip

## ZERO LIBRARIES FOR CSS

I want to practice css
