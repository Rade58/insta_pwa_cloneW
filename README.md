# My project made for practicing pwa techologies

## Bundled with webpack

### Webpack configuration is made to have multiple entry points and multiple outputs

Two pages are needed, with one fallback page (for offline if one of the pages isn't availeable)

### Service Worker I'm going to test only in production so it is going to be placed by hand inside build folder (dist FOLDER)

Folder needs to be on same file/folder level as the the index.html
